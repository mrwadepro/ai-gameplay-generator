Minigame 1: 
Learning Goal Code: AS.01.01
Description: This interactive game will teach students about the origins, domestication, and distribution of farm animals.
Game Mechanics: The game will consist of collecting cards containing information about different animals. The player can learn about each animal's history, the region where it was first domesticated, and the area it lives in today. There will be a map where players can place the animals in their corresponding regions as they learn about them.
Game Flow: The player begins with a set of animal cards. They select an animal card to learn more about its origin, domestication, and distribution. After acquiring enough information about the animal, they must place them on the map. The game continues until the player has learned about all the animals and placed each one on the map.

Sub-Goal 1: Recognize the animal's origin, domestication, and distribution - Each animal card contains this information, and the map placement reinforces this learning.
Sub-Goal 2: Evaluate the impact of domestication and distribution on current animal production practices - Throughout the game, the student will find hints on how domestication and distribution impact current farming practices. Successfully placing the animal in the proper location indicates an understanding of these impacts.
